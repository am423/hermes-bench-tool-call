# hermesbenchv0.1 — Plan

A simple, reproducible benchmark for evaluating local models running inside the
**Hermes Agent** harness. Captures full traces (every tool call + tool result)
so the same dataset doubles as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) training data.

> Repo: `github.com/am423/hermesbenchv0_1` (private)
> Folder: `~/projects/hermesbenchv0_1/`
> v0.1 = first usable release. v0.2+ will add multi-modal, longer-horizon, and
> adversarial tool-failure scenarios.

## 1. Why this exists

Generic agent benchmarks (SWE-bench, AgentBench, ToolBench, τ-bench) test
broad reasoning, but **none of them are calibrated against the actual tool
surface, argument shapes, and failure envelopes a model sees inside
`run_agent.AIAgent`**. We want:

1. A score that predicts how a model will perform **in our harness, on our
   tool set, with our JSON error envelopes** — not on someone else's.
2. A captured trace for every run, in the exact message format the harness
   produces (`role: system|user|assistant|tool`, `tool_calls` JSON, `tool_call_id`
   pairing, `success: bool` results), suitable for SFT without reformatting.
3. Tasks that fit on a single local box (no Docker orchestration, no live
   internet required, no API keys) so they run on the same Arc B70 / RTX 3090
   hardware we already benchmark LLMs on.

### Data grounding

Pulled from `~/.hermes/state.db` (327 sessions, 18,541 messages, 9,224
assistant-issued tool invocations). Tool distribution:

| Tool | Count | Share | Why it's in the benchmark |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `terminal` | 4,763 | 51.6% | Core: build, run, test, inspect |
| `read_file` | 1,167 | 12.6% | Paginated source-code reading |
| `patch` | 932 | 10.1% | Surgical code edits w/ fuzzy match |
| `search_files` | 515 | 5.6% | `rg`-backed content & file search |
| `write_file` | 446 | 4.8% | New file creation |
| `process` | 294 | 3.2% | Long-running bg process mgmt |
| `todo` | 268 | 2.9% | Multi-step planning |
| `skill_view` | 263 | 2.9% | Skill lookup |
| `execute_code` | 184 | 2.0% | Python REPL via kernel |
| `web_search` | 125 | 1.4% | Grounded lookups |
| `web_extract` | 72 | 0.8% | URL → markdown |
| `vision_analyze` | 36 | 0.4% | Image Q&A |
| `delegate_task` | 36 | 0.4% | Subagent fan-out |
| `memory` | 22 | 0.2% | Persistent facts |
| `clarify` | 20 | 0.2% | Asking the user |
| `browser_*` | 38 | 0.4% | Browser automation |
| _other_ | 89 | 1.0% | `skills_list`, `cronjob`, etc. |

**Top 6 = 88% of traffic.** Top 10 = 96%. v0.1 covers the top 6 + 4
"common but different" tools (todo, execute_code, web_search, memory) for a
10-tool surface. v0.2+ layers in browser/vision/delegate/skill_view.

Median session = 34 tool-call turns. p90 = 186. v0.1 tasks are sized 5-30
turns so they finish in 2-15 min on a 7B model.

---

## 2. Design principles

| Principle | Decision |
|---|---|
| **Simple** | Single Python entry point, no Docker, no orchestrator. Runtime deps: `pyyaml`, `pyte` (for cast capture). Build deps: `agg` binary for GIF render. |
| **Reproducible** | Tasks ship a deterministic input fixture (committed to repo). Same input → same expected output. Network-disabled by default. |
| **Hermes-shaped** | Tasks are run via the real `AIAgent`, spawned as a subprocess, with `TERMINAL_ENV=tmux_isolated` so the model sees real tool schemas, real error envelopes, real conversation flow. No in-process wrapping. |
| **Isolated** | Each task gets a fresh `tmux` session, a fresh worktree, and an isolated `$HOME`. Network is `unshare --net` by default. Cleanup is signal-safe. |
| **Trace-capturing** | Every run writes `traces/<model>_<task>_<timestamp>.jsonl` with one line per message in the exact format the harness produces. |
| **X-shareable** | Every task also produces a `.cast` file (asciinema v2 format) of the model's terminal session, captured via `tmux pipe-pane` from the moment the task starts to cleanup. Render to GIF/MP4 with one command. |
| **SFT-ready** | Each trace is a complete conversation (`system → user → assistant(tool_calls) → tool → ... → assistant(content)`). We can slice it into `(prompt, completion)` pairs directly. |
| **Scored** | Each task has a deterministic verifier. No LLM-as-judge in v0.1. |
| **Fast feedback** | Per-task wall-clock + token count printed. Per-model summary table. |

### Non-goals (v0.1)

- Multi-modal tasks (vision/browser) → v0.2
- Adversarial prompt injection → v0.3
- Long-horizon planning (100+ turns) → v0.2
- Live network calls → v0.2 (with a `network: required` flag per task)
- LLM-as-judge for free-form answers → never, by design

---

## 3. Architecture

The core design decision: **isolation lives at the environment layer, not the
harness layer.** Hermes already has a pluggable `BaseEnvironment` backend
(local, docker, ssh, modal, daytona, singularity) selected by the
`TERMINAL_ENV` env var. Rather than wrap or replace `AIAgent`, we add a
**new backend: `tmux_isolated`**. Each benchmark task spins up a fresh
tmux session inside a fresh worktree, and the model runs against the real
`AIAgent` exactly as it would in production — same tool schemas, same error
envelopes, same conversation loop. The only thing different is the box
underneath.

### Why tmux (not docker, not a wrapper)

- **Hermes already has docker isolation** — but a Docker container breaks
  our ability to test model behavior in the *same environment* a user runs
  (no shared GPU, no shared `~/.cache/huggingface`, no shared tool
  installations, no realistic filesystem latency). The benchmark would
  measure "model on a cold box" not "model in our user's world."
- **tmux gives us isolation without virtualization.** Each task gets:
  - a fresh `tmux` session (`hermesbench-<task_id>-<uuid>`)
  - a fresh working directory (git worktree or tmp dir) that the model
    can freely `rm -rf` without nuking anything real
  - a fresh `$HOME` redirect (so `~/.bash_history`, `memory` tool
    state, and shell config are clean)
  - network-isolated mode optional (`unshare --net` if the task needs it)
  - guaranteed cleanup on exit (signal-safe tmux kill)
- **It's a thin backend**, ~150 LOC following the existing `LocalEnvironment`
  pattern, so the `BaseEnvironment` ABC gives us CWD tracking, session
  snapshot, and timeout enforcement for free.
- **The model doesn't know it's isolated.** It still calls `terminal`,
  `read_file`, `write_file`, `patch` — the only difference is that
  `terminal` is now backed by `tmux send-keys` + `tmux capture-pane` in a
  fresh session. This is exactly how a user running hermes-agent in a
  detached tmux session would experience it.

### 3.1 The `TmuxIsolatedEnvironment` backend

Subclass of `BaseEnvironment` in
`hermesbench/backend/tmux_isolated.py`. ~150 LOC. Mirrors `LocalEnvironment`
but:

```python
class TmuxIsolatedEnvironment(BaseEnvironment):
    def __init__(self, *, session_name: str, worktree: Path, isolated_home: Path,
                 network: bool = True, timeout: int = 120, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(cwd=str(worktree), timeout=timeout, **kwargs)
        self._session = session_name
        self._worktree = worktree
        self._isolated_home = isolated_home
        self._network = network
        # Created in init_session(); killed in cleanup().

    def init_session(self):
        # 1. `tmux new-session -d -s $self._session -c $self._worktree`
        # 2. `tmux send-keys -t $self._session 'export HOME=...; export PS1=; stty -echo' Enter`
        # 3. capture snapshot as in LocalEnvironment.init_session()
        super().init_session()  # writes /tmp/hermes-snap-*.sh inside the session

    def _run_bash(self, cmd_string, *, login=False, timeout=120, stdin_data=None):
        # If network=False: wrap with `unshare --net` inside the tmux send-keys
        # path. Otherwise plain bash -c as LocalEnvironment does.
        # Returns a _ThreadedProcessHandle that wraps tmux capture-pane polling.
        ...

    def cleanup(self):
        # signal-safe: `tmux kill-session -t $self._session` then
        # `rm -rf $self._worktree $self._isolated_home`
        # Idempotent: safe to call from a SIGTERM handler.
        ...
```

Key properties:
- **One tmux session per task** — not per tool call. This matches what a
  user actually does (`tmux new -s work`, run the agent, attach to watch).
- **Bash state persists across tool calls** within a task (the model can
  `cd`, `export VAR=foo`, start a long-running process and check it next
  turn). This is *crucial* — Hermes' `process` tool is built on the
  assumption of session-level persistence.
- **Worktree + isolated `$HOME` per task** — model can `rm -rf` the
  worktree, write to `~/.config/whatever`, run `git push` — none of it
  leaks to the host.
- **Optional `--net` isolation** — for tasks that should be hermetic (most
  file/code tasks), the tmux session can run under `unshare --net` so the
  model literally cannot reach the internet. Web-lookup tasks explicitly
  opt out.
- **Snapshot file lives inside the worktree** (`$worktree/.hermes-snap.sh`),
  not `/tmp`, so the session is fully self-contained.

### 3.1a Terminal capture for X sharing (always-on)

Every task records its full terminal session as an asciinema v2 `.cast`
file. This is the artifact you post to X — no extra work, no model
behavior change. Wire-up is purely at the `tmux` layer via
`pipe-pane`, so the model has zero idea it's being recorded.

**Capture mechanism — `tmux pipe-pane` to a python `pyte` screen
emulator.** Two-step:

1. **Attach a pipe** in `init_session()`:
   ```bash
   tmux pipe-pane -t $SESSION -o "python3 $HERMESBENCH/recorder.py $CAST_FILE"
   ```
2. **The recorder** is a 80-LOC Python script that uses `pyte` (a
   pure-Python VT100/xterm emulator) to maintain a screen buffer, then
   flushes diffs to the `.cast` file in asciinema v2 format on a
   100ms tick.

Why this design:
- **`pyte` is screen-accurate** — it understands ANSI escape codes, cursor
  movement, color, alternate screen buffer, `\r` progress bars, etc.
  Critical because models use progress bars (`pip install`, `cargo
  build`, `pytest -v`) all the time and we don't want the cast to
  look like garbled text.
- **Diff-based flush** is the asciinema v2 idiom — we don't dump the full
  screen every frame, we emit only what changed, so file sizes stay
  small (typical 5-minute cast ≈ 50-200 KB).
- **Always-on, zero opt-in** — every `TmuxIsolatedEnvironment.init_session()`
  pipes unconditionally. The `.cast` file is one of the canonical
  artifacts alongside the trace jsonl.

**Layout addition:**

```
hermesbench/
├── backend/
│   ├── tmux_isolated.py        # BaseEnvironment subclass
│   └── recorder.py             # pyte-based pipe-pane sink → .cast
```

**CLI to render `.cast` to shareable formats:**

```bash
# GIF (default for X, Twitter caps at 15MB; we target <8MB)
python -m hermesbench render trace.cast --format gif --out trace.gif

# MP4 (better quality, can host anywhere)
python -m hermesbench render trace.cast --format mp4 --out trace.mp4

# Trim (drop the first/last N seconds; for skipping warmup)
python -m hermesbench render trace.cast --format gif --trim-start 5s --trim-end 2s

# Speed up boring parts (e.g. apt-get install) — model finished, viewer doesn't need 30s
python -m hermesbench render trace.cast --format gif --speed 2.0

# Concat multiple tasks into one reel
python -m hermesbench render-reel traces/qwen*.cast --format gif --out reel.gif
```

**Render backend stack (no install surprises):**

| Format | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `.cast` | `pyte` + our recorder | Source of truth, replayable with `asciinema play` |
| `.gif` | `agg` (asciinema gif generator) | High-quality, palette-aware, the de-facto choice for X |
| `.mp4` | `ffmpeg` (already on system) | Universal, 1080p+ |
| `.txt` | raw terminal log (cat) | For README embedding |
| `.svg` | `termsvg` if installed | Static screenshots |

`agg` is a single Rust binary (~3 MB), pull it as a build dep or pin
version. `ffmpeg` is already installed. The `render` CLI checks
availability and degrades gracefully — if `agg` missing, fall back to
`ffmpeg` + a quick `chafa` frame rasterization (no install needed
beyond ffmpeg).

**What gets captured (and what doesn't):**

- ✅ All `terminal` tool output — this is the whole point
- ✅ All error messages, stack traces, prompts the model sees
- ✅ Model's own thinking? **No.** We capture the *terminal*, not the
  LLM's hidden chain-of-thought. Reasoning_content stays in the jsonl
  trace, not in the cast.
- ✅ TUI elements, progress bars, pagers (`less`, `vim`, `htop`) — `pyte`
  handles alternate screen buffer correctly
- ❌ TUI prompts (the hermes REPL's spinner, etc.) — they don't exist
  in `--no-tui --print-mode jsonl` mode anyway

**X-specific quality notes:**

- X video caps at 140s / 500MB. Most task casts are 30-120s. If a task
  runs longer, `render` auto-suggests `--speed 2.0` to halve length.
- X autoplay is muted — visual hooks matter. The `render` CLI has a
  `--add-caption` flag that overlays the task name + pass/fail at the
  start, e.g.:
  `t03_patch_edit / t02_patch_ambiguous — ✅ PASS — qwen2.5-coder-7b`
- Watermark? Optional `--watermark "hermesbench v0.1"` in the corner
  (per the user's YC-quality + branding bar; matches the watermark
  convention from the ascii-video skill — visible from frame 0, no
  fade-in, so loops are seamless).

**Sanity test (added to CI):**

```python
def test_recorder_roundtrip():
    """A 5-line bash session should produce a valid .cast that re-renders."""
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:
        cast = Path(d) / "x.cast"
        run_in_tmux("echo hello; sleep 0.2; ls; echo done", cast_path=cast)
        # Round-trip: read the cast, verify it's valid asciinema v2
        frames = list(read_cast(cast))
        assert len(frames) >= 4
        assert "hello" in screen_text(frames[-1])
        # And it renders without error
        gif = render(cast, format="gif")
        assert gif.stat().st_size > 1000
```

### 3.2 The hermes-agent invocation

The benchmark runner does **not** import `AIAgent` as a library. Instead it
**spawns hermes-agent as a subprocess per task**:

```python
# hermesbench/hermes_invocation.py (sketch)
def run_task(task: TaskSpec, model: str, base_url: str) -> Path:
    worktree = worktree_setup(task)
    session_name = f"hermesbench-{task.id}-{uuid4().hex[:8]}"
    isolated_home = mkdtemp(prefix="hermesbench-home-")

    # Start tmux session with isolated env
    env_overrides = {
        "TERMINAL_ENV": "tmux_isolated",       # our new backend
        "HERMES_TMUX_SESSION": session_name,
        "HERMES_TMUX_WORKTREE": str(worktree),
        "HERMES_TMUX_HOME": str(isolated_home),
        "HERMES_TMUX_NET": "off" if task.isolated_network else "on",
        "OPENAI_BASE_URL": base_url,
        "OPENAI_MODEL": model,
        "HERMES_QUIET": "1",                   # no TUI noise
        "HERMES_SAVE_TRAJECTORY": "1",         # so hermes writes its own session
        "HERMES_TRAJECTORY_PATH": str(worktree / ".hermes-traj.jsonl"),
    }

    # Spawn hermes-agent in a way that streams all messages to our trace
    proc = subprocess.Popen(
        ["python", "-m", "hermes_agent", "--print-mode", "jsonl", "--no-tui"],
        cwd=worktree, env={**os.environ, **env_overrides},
        stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE, text=True,
    )
    # Feed the task prompt via stdin (hermes reads it on first turn)
    proc.stdin.write(task.prompt + "\n")
    proc.stdin.flush()

    # Stream every line of hermes's jsonl output into our trace file
    trace_path = worktree / f"trace-{task.id}.jsonl"
    with trace_path.open("w") as f:
        for line in proc.stdout:
            f.write(line)
    proc.wait(timeout=task.timeout_seconds)
    return trace_path
```

The `--print-mode jsonl` flag is the only upstream change we ask for in
`hermes-agent`: it makes hermes print every message it sends/receives
(system, user, assistant, tool) as a jsonl line on stdout. We capture
that stream as the trace. **This is the minimal invasive change** —
everything else (tool schemas, error envelopes, conversation flow) is
hermes's existing behavior.

If `--print-mode jsonl` doesn't exist upstream yet, our fallback is to
write a small hermes-agent plugin (`hermes_observability/print_jsonl.py`)
that hooks the message stream and prints to stdout. Even less invasive.

### 3.3 Why this is better than a wrapper

| Approach | Faithful to hermes? | Easy to maintain? | Trivial cleanup? | Captures real traces? |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Subprocess hermes + tmux backend | ✓ exact | ✓ hermes stays unchanged | ✓ SIGTERM → kill tmux → rm worktree | ✓ real conversation |
| In-process `AIAgent` wrapper | ⚠ re-entrancy bugs in plugins | ✗ every hermes API change breaks us | ✗ exceptions can leak host state | ✓ real conversation |
| Custom slim harness (Mode B) | ✗ missing skills, memory, hooks | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ not real hermes |
| Docker per task | ✗ no shared GPU/cache | ✗ docker-in-docker on CI | ⚠ `docker rm -f` can hang | ✓ real conversation |

**Mode B (slim harness) is still kept** for hermes-less CI smoke tests
(e.g. `pytest tests/test_verifiers.py` doesn't need hermes-agent
installed). But the **canonical benchmark runs in subprocess mode** with
the tmux backend.

Mode selection:
- `python -m hermesbench run --task ...` → subprocess + tmux (default)
- `python -m hermesbench run --task ... --slim` → in-process slim harness
  (for hermes-less CI; flagged in results so it's never compared head-to-head)

### Trace format (one jsonl line per harness message)

```json
{"role": "system", "content": "...", "ts": 1700000000.0}
{"role": "user", "content": "Fix the off-by-one in src/calc.py", "ts": ...}
{"role": "assistant", "content": null, "tool_calls": [
  {"id": "call_1", "type": "function",
   "function": {"name": "read_file",
                "arguments": "{\"path\": \"src/calc.py\"}"}}], "ts": ...}
{"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_1",
 "name": "read_file",
 "content": "{\"success\": true, \"content\": \"...\"}", "ts": ...}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Done. The bug was...", "ts": ...}
```

This is the **exact wire format** `AIAgent.run_conversation()` produces, so
traces are SFT-ready with zero transformation.

## 4. Task taxonomy (40 tasks in v0.1)

Each task is a directory with:
- `task.yaml` — name, prompt, allowed_tools, max_turns, expected_artifacts
- `verifier.py` — deterministic Python function returning `(passed: bool, details: dict)`
- `fixture/` — committed input data (gitignored size caps apply)

| `t03_terminal_pipeline` | Pipe `cat \| grep \| wc` | Multi-command chaining |
| `t04_terminal_env` | Check an env var that does/doesn't exist | Reading error messages |

## 5. Scoring

Per-task score = `verifier.py` returns `passed: bool`. Aggregate:

- **Pass rate** = tasks passed / tasks attempted (primary metric)
- **Tool-use efficiency** = median tool calls per task (lower = better, with floor)
- **Token efficiency** = input+output tokens / task
- **Wall-clock** = seconds / task
- **Recovery rate** = % of `success: false` tool results followed by a correct
  next move within 2 turns (measures error-recovery skill)
- **Format compliance** = % of tool calls with valid JSON `arguments` matching
  the schema (no extra/missing keys, right types)

A single model produces a results row like:

```
model: qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct-q4_k_m
pass_rate:        28/40 (70.0%)
tool_efficiency:  median 6.1 calls/task
token_efficiency:  14,200 tok/task avg
wall_clock:       38.4 s/task avg
recovery_rate:    81.2%
format_compliance: 99.4%
```

### Verifier pattern

```python
# hermesbench/tasks/t03_patch_edit/t02_patch_ambiguous/verifier.py
def verify(workdir: Path, trace: list[dict]) -> tuple[bool, dict]:
    target = workdir / "src" / "config.py"
    if not target.exists():
        return False, {"reason": "file missing"}
    content = target.read_text()
    # Expect: only ONE block of `TIMEOUT = 30` (the duplicated one was fixed)
    count = content.count("TIMEOUT = 30")
    if count != 1:
        return False, {"reason": f"expected 1 'TIMEOUT=30', got {count}"}
    return True, {"checks": {"timeout_count": count}}
```

## 7. Implementation phases

### Phase 1 — Skeleton + `TmuxIsolatedEnvironment` backend (Day 1-3)
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` + `hermesbench/` package skeleton (deps: `pyyaml`, `pyte`)
- [ ] `backend/tmux_isolated.py` — first cut: `init_session`, `_run_bash`, `cleanup`
- [ ] `backend/recorder.py` — `pyte`-based pipe-pane sink that writes
      asciinema v2 `.cast` files (80 LOC + roundtrip test)
- [ ] Wire `tmux pipe-pane` into `init_session()` so every task
      records automatically
- [ ] `backend/worktree.py` — `worktree_setup(task)` copies fixtures, sets up isolated `$HOME`
- [ ] `runner.py` — task lifecycle: setup → spawn hermes → trace → teardown
- [ ] Manual smoke test: 1 task against a real model, confirm tmux session is
      created, model runs, **`.cast` is produced and re-playable**,
      tmux is killed, worktree is removed
- [ ] Add the `TERMINAL_ENV=tmux_isolated` branch to hermes-agent's
      `_create_environment()` factory (1-line PR to `tools/terminal_tool.py`)

### Phase 2 — `hermes_invocation.py` + jsonl trace streaming (Day 4-5)
- [ ] Spawn `python -m hermes_agent --print-mode jsonl --no-tui` as a subprocess
- [ ] Stream every jsonl line from hermes's stdout into the trace file
- [ ] If `--print-mode jsonl` doesn't exist upstream, build the
      `hermes_observability/print_jsonl.py` plugin as a fallback
- [ ] Verify trace format matches the wire format in §3 "Trace format"

### Phase 3 — Author 40 tasks (Day 6-10)
- [ ] Categories 1-6 (29 tasks): file/terminal/process — the 88% bulk
- [ ] Categories 7-10 (11 tasks): todo/exec_code/web/memory
- [ ] Each task gets: `task.yaml`, `verifier.py`, fixture data
- [ ] Each task declares `isolated_network: bool` in `task.yaml`
      (defaults to `false` for hermeticity)
- [ ] Commit fixtures to repo (size cap: 100 KB per fixture, gzip if larger)

### Phase 4 — Mode B (slim harness) for hermes-less CI (Day 11)
- [ ] `HermesBenchHarness` 200-line implementation
- [ ] Auto-fallback test: hermes-less env, confirm Mode B runs
- [ ] Results from Mode B runs are tagged `mode=slim` so they're never
      compared head-to-head with subprocess mode

### Phase 5 — Scoring + reporting (Day 12)
- [ ] `scoring.py` computes all 6 metrics
- [ ] `results/<model>_<date>.json` per-run aggregate
- [ ] Pretty-print summary table
- [ ] `cli.py` `render` subcommand: `.cast` → `.gif` / `.mp4` via `agg` + `ffmpeg`
- [ ] `cli.py` `render-reel` subcommand: concat multiple casts
- [ ] `cli.py` `play` subcommand: `asciinema play` wrapper for local preview
- [ ] `examples/` directory seeded with 3 reference GIFs (one per
      difficulty tier: easy/medium/hard) so README screenshots stay
      accurate when the suite evolves

### Phase 6 — Export to SFT format (Day 13)
- [ ] `export-sft` command: traces → OpenAI / ShareGPT / Hermes message formats
- [ ] Sanity check: load exported SFT jsonl, count completions, inspect a sample

### Phase 7 — Initial baseline runs (Day 14-15)
- [ ] Run against 3 representative local models: a small (3-4B), a medium (7-8B), a large (32-70B)
- [ ] Publish `results/baseline_<date>.md` in the repo
- [ ] Commit traces (or a sample of them) so others can reproduce
- [ ] Confirm: every task's tmux session was killed, every worktree was rm-rf'd
      (post-mortem script scans `/tmp` and `tmux ls` for leaks)

### Phase 8 — v0.1 release tag (Day 16)
- [ ] README with quick-start, results table, "how to add a task" guide,
      "how to add a new environment backend" guide
- [ ] Open upstream PR to hermes-agent: register `tmux_isolated` backend
- [ ] `git tag v0.1`
- [ ] Internal dogfood: run the suite in our own dev loop for 1 week,
      fix anything that breaks

---

## 8. v0.2+ roadmap (out of scope for v0.1, listed for context)

- **v0.2 — Multi-modal + longer horizon:** vision tasks (image Q&A), browser tasks (offline mock DOM), 60-100 turn projects
- **v0.3 — Adversarial:** prompt-injection resistance, ambiguous user prompts, broken-tool recovery
- **v0.4 — Live net:** opt-in `network: required` flag, real `web_search`/`web_extract`
- **v0.5 — Cross-session:** tasks that span multiple `AIAgent` sessions with persistent memory
- **v0.6 — Skill usage:** force-load a skill, test if model invokes `skill_view` to read it
- **v1.0 — Public leaderboard:** website hosting results, model submission PR workflow

---

## 9. Success criteria for v0.1

- [ ] All 40 tasks have a passing implementation
- [ ] `python -m hermesbench run --all` works on a fresh checkout in <30 min on a 7B model
- [ ] Three baseline models run cleanly, results published
- [ ] At least 100 trace jsonl files committed (dogfooding)
- [ ] `export-sft` produces a valid jsonl that fine-tunes a model to ≥+5% pass-rate on a held-out task
- [ ] README lets a new user run their first task in <5 min
- [ ] `TmuxIsolatedEnvironment` backend passes a leak test: after 40 task
      runs, `tmux ls` shows no `hermesbench-*` sessions and
      `/tmp/hermesbench-*` is empty
- [ ] `hermes-agent` upstream has the `TERMINAL_ENV=tmux_isolated` branch
      merged (or our patch is vendored in `hermes_agent_patch/`)
- [ ] Subprocess-mode runs use real `AIAgent`; verified by grepping
      trace jsonl for messages whose `role=tool` carries
      `success: bool` envelopes (a sign the real tool handlers ran)
- [ ] Every task run produces a valid `.cast` file (verified by
      `test_recorder_roundtrip` in CI)
- [ ] `python -m hermesbench render trace.cast --format gif` produces
      a <8MB GIF that captures the model's terminal faithfully
      (manual QA: progress bars, colors, errors all readable)
- [ ] At least 3 example X-ready GIFs are committed to
      `examples/` so users can see what the output looks like before
      running their first task

## 10. Open questions

1. **Hermes subprocess vs in-process?** Subprocess is more faithful but
   slower (Python startup × 40 tasks ≈ +60s). **Decision: subprocess +
   tmux backend, always. Speed is not the bottleneck.**
2. **Mode A vs Mode B in CI?** Mode A drags in all of hermes-agent's
   deps. If we want a slim CI image, Mode B is the path. **Decision: ship
   both, default to subprocess Mode A, tag results with mode so they
   can't be confused.**
3. **What fixture size cap?** 100 KB / task keeps the repo under 5 MB.
   **Decision: 100 KB; document the cap in `tasks/_schema.py`.**
4. **Token-budget per task?** Unbounded makes 70B models OOM.
   **Decision: 8K context hard cap per task, configurable up to 32K.
   Refused if exceeded.**
5. **Should verifiers be allowed to import hermes-agent?** No — verifiers
   must be stdlib-only so they're portable. **Decision: enforce via lint.**
6. **Live web tasks in v0.1?** No — adds flakiness. **Decision: mock
   corpus for v0.1, opt-in live in v0.4. Tasks opt into network via
   `isolated_network: true` in `task.yaml`.**
7. **Should the tmux session be persistent across turns or per-call?**
   Persistent — the model's `process` tool assumes long-running bg
   processes can be polled across turns. **Decision: one tmux session
   per task, killed in `cleanup()`.**
8. **`unshare --net` or full network namespace?** `--net` only is enough
   for our hermeticity goal (block internet, keep loopback for
   localhost). **Decision: `unshare --net` per session when
   `isolated_network: false`.**
9. **What if hermes-agent doesn't have `--print-mode jsonl` yet?**
   Fallback: ship a 50-LOC `print_jsonl` plugin that hooks the message
   stream. **Decision: try CLI flag first, fall back to plugin. Both
   paths land in v0.1.**
10. **What cast format should we own long-term?** asciinema v2 (`.cast`)
    is the standard — tools like `agg`, `asciinema-player`, and `termsvg`
    all consume it. **Decision: asciinema v2 is the source of truth, GIF
    is the rendered derivative.**
11. **Does the cast include the prompt the model sees, or only its
    output?** The whole terminal — prompt + output + errors. The model's
    first user turn is `echo`-ed by hermes's print-mode anyway, so
    reviewers see "Task: fix this off-by-one" → model's response. This
    is what makes the cast self-explanatory on X. **Decision: capture
    the entire pane.**
12. **Cast file size growth?** 5-min cast ≈ 50-200 KB at 100ms tick
    with diff-based flush. 40 tasks × 5 min = ~8 MB of casts per model
    run. Acceptable for `traces/`. **Decision: keep all casts by
    default, add `.gitignore`-friendly `--keep-casts=false` for bulk
    runs.**
13. **Render server-side or via `agg` local?** `agg` is a single static
    binary, no server needed. **Decision: local render. CI uploads
    GIFs as PR artifacts.**
